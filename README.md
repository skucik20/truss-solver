A simple application to calculate displacements of truss structures
A simple application to calculate displacements of truss structures

The calculations work only for statically determinate systems 
Note that there is no implemented condition checking the static determinability of the structure 
there is also no material library implemented, calculations made for stainless steel (material parameters must be changed in the code) 
The calculations are made by fine element: rod, i.e. only compression and tension are taken into account in this mathematical model
